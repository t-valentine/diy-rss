# DIY RSS Feed Reader

This is a heavily commented, beginner friendly RSS Feed Reader Extension- made for [Webcomic Day 2023](https://webcomicday.com/). A website explaining the project can be found [here](diyrss.neocities.org).

## What it does

Editing the `feeds` array in `background.js` allows you to add webcomic's (or other website's) RSS feeds so you can follow them. Clicking on the extension displays a list of RSS Feeds you're following, and when they last updated with a link to view that update.

The extension has a badge that will appear if an RSS feed you follow updated today.
